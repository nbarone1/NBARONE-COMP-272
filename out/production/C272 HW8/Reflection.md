Unfortunately, my code enhancements attempts failed.
I was getting timing results of 248 ms - Fly, 12 ms - Dfs, 594 ms - BFS for Enron.
However, Fly gives the most accurate results for sizes and number connected components.
It appears that for accuracy Fly is the bets but my DFS runs the fastest.  In editing to improve functionality,
    I messed up those methods and could not fix them in time.
